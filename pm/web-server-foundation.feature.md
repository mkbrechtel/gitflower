# Feature: Web Server Foundation

## Overview
Enhance the existing web server to provide a solid foundation for CodeFlow's web interface, supporting repository browsing, code review, and documentation features.

## Goals
- Provide a robust HTTP server with proper routing
- Support static file serving with caching
- Enable template-based rendering with layouts
- Integrate with repository management system
- Support Git HTTP protocol for cloning repositories
- Prepare foundation for code review interface

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to access the web interface to browse my repositories
2. As a user, I want to view repository details and navigate through the file tree
3. As a user, I want the web interface to be fast and responsive
4. As a user, I want to see proper error pages when something goes wrong
5. As a developer, I want a well-structured web server that's easy to extend
6. As a user, I want clear URLs like `/repos/my-project.git` for repositories
7. As a user, I want to clone repositories via HTTP using `git clone http://localhost:8080/repos/my-project.git`

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Server
- [ ] HTTP server with configurable address/port
- [ ] Graceful shutdown support
- [ ] Request logging middleware
- [ ] Error handling with custom error pages
- [ ] Static file serving with proper MIME types
- [ ] Cache headers for static assets

### Routing
- [ ] Repository URLs under `/repos/` prefix
- [ ] Static files served from `/static/` path  
- [ ] Repository identification by `.git` suffix
- [ ] Organization folders without `.git` suffix
- [ ] Root path `/` shows main page with repository list
- [ ] Repository list: `/repos/`
- [ ] Repository view: `/repos/my-project.git`
- [ ] Organization folder view: `/repos/work/`
- [ ] Nested repository: `/repos/work/backend-api.git`
- [ ] File browsing: `/repos/my-project.git/tree/{ref}/{path}`
- [ ] Commit viewing: `/repos/my-project.git/commit/{sha}`
- [ ] Documentation routes: `/docs/{page}`
- [ ] Follow slug format [a-z0-9-.] for all names

### Templates
- [ ] Base layout template with navigation
- [ ] Repository list page
- [ ] Repository detail page
- [ ] File browser interface
- [ ] Error pages (404, 500)
- [ ] Documentation viewer

### Repository Integration
- [ ] List repositories from configured directory
- [ ] Show repository metadata (size, branches, last update)
- [ ] Navigate repository file tree
- [ ] Display file contents with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Handle binary files appropriately

### Git HTTP Protocol
- [ ] Support Git smart HTTP protocol for cloning
- [ ] Handle `/repos/{name}.git/info/refs` for repository discovery
- [ ] Handle `/repos/{name}.git/git-upload-pack` for fetching objects
- [ ] Read-only access (no push support)
- [ ] Proper Content-Type headers for Git operations
- [ ] Support for both dumb and smart HTTP protocols

### Security
- [ ] Path traversal prevention
- [ ] Read-only operations only
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Proper Content-Security-Policy headers

### Performance
- [ ] Page load time < 200ms for repository list
- [ ] Efficient file reading for large files
- [ ] Static asset caching
- [ ] Template caching in production
