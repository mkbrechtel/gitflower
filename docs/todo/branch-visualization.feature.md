# Feature: Branch Visualization

## Overview
Provide interactive visualizations of Git branch relationships, commit history, and merge request dependencies to help users understand complex development workflows.

## Goals
- Visualize branch relationships and merge points
- Show commit history in an intuitive vertical graph format
- Highlight release branches, tags, and important commits
- Display merge request overlay on branches
- Support navigation through large repositories

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see an interactive graph of all branches, their relationships, and merge points to understand project structure
2. As a user, I want to click on commits to see details and navigate through the commit history
3. As a user, I want release branches and tags clearly highlighted to track versions and deployments
4. As a user, I want to see merge requests overlaid on branches with their dependencies visualized
5. As a user, I want to search and navigate within large repository graphs efficiently
6. As an AI agent, I want to query branch topology and relationships programmatically
