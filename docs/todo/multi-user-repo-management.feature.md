# Feature: Multi-User Repository Management

## Overview
Enable multiple users on a Linux system to share bare Git repositories with proper access control using a SUID helper binary.

## Goals
- Support multi-user environments with shared repositories
- Maintain security through proper SUID binary implementation
- Integrate with POSIX permissions and groups
- Enable collaborative development on shared systems

## User Stories

1. As a system administrator, I want to install a global GitFlower instance that multiple users can use
2. As a user, I want to access shared repositories based on my group membership
3. As a user, I want my private repositories to remain inaccessible to other users
4. As an administrator, I want to manage repository access through standard POSIX groups

## Acceptance Criteria

### SUID Helper Binary
- [ ] Separate binary with minimal attack surface
- [ ] Validates all inputs before operations
- [ ] Drops privileges appropriately
- [ ] Only performs necessary Git operations

### Access Control
- [ ] Repository access based on filesystem permissions
- [ ] Group-based repository sharing
- [ ] User home directory repositories remain private
- [ ] System-wide repository directory with group access

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Requires Podman container for multi-user testing
- [ ] Test privilege escalation scenarios
- [ ] Verify permission boundaries
- [ ] Test group-based access control

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using capabilities instead of SUID where possible
- Audit all filesystem operations in SUID context
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Document security considerations thoroughly
